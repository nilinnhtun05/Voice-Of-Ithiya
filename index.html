     <h1>Gender Discrimination Within </h1>

        <main>
            
<p>Buddhism is generally regarded as the religion with the least gender discrimination. One notion might be its focus on asceticism and philosophy, where the teaches are detached from mundane worldly affairs<a href="#sdendnote1sym" name="sdendnote1anc"><sup>i</sup></a>. Nirvana, the goal of Buddhism, can be attained by both sexes<a href="#sdendnote2sym" name="sdendnote2anc"><sup>ii</sup></a>. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is no such thing as male or female; there are only the five aggregates, and these aggregates are of the nature of impermanence, constantly arising and passing away (Annicca). This prominent example is found in the<u><a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn5.2/en/bodhi?lang=en&amp;reference=none&amp;highlight=false"> Soma sutta</a></u> of the Bhikkhuni Samyutta, where the bhikkhuni Soma said to Mara, &ldquo;One to whom it might occur, 'I'm a woman' or 'I'm a man' Or 'I'm anything at all' &mdash; Is fit for Mara to address.&rdquo;<a href="#sdendnote3sym" name="sdendnote3anc"><sup>iii</sup></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, gender discrimination is not entirely absent in Buddhism. The most obvious example is the first of the eight Garudhammas (weighty rules) for bhikkhunis: &lsquo;Even a bhikkhuni who has been ordained for a hundred years must respectfully greet, rise to meet, bow down to, and show due reverence to a bhikkhu ordained even that very day.&rsquo; Some justify this rule by claiming it was a concession to the patriarchal Indian society of that era<a href="#sdendnote4sym" name="sdendnote4anc"><sup>iv</sup></a>. According to this argument, the issue of combating patriarchy was a worldly matter and thus not related to the Buddha; hence he did not oppose patriarchy. Given this perspective, further criticism is not possible since Buddha and Feminism have different concerns on certain matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another important issue is the belief that women cannot attain Buddhahood. In <u><a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.278-286/en/sujato?lang=en&amp;layout=plain&amp;reference=none&amp;notes=asterisk&amp;highlight=false&amp;script=latin">(AN 1.279&ndash;286)</a></u> of the Tipitaka, it is stated that women cannot become a Chakaravati Raja, a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha, Indra, Mara, or King of Brahma; there is no possibility or reason for women to become one&mdash;only men have the potential and opportunity. Thus, it is implied that women not only cannot become Buddhas in this life but also have no chance of becoming Buddhas in future lives in a female body. If a woman wants to become a Buddha, she has to transition from a female to a male form, and then from a male form to a Buddha, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this matter, some people, without basing on Tipitaka, speculate that the reason women cannot become Buddha is due to social karma. If there were a matriarchal society, the one destined to become a Buddha would have the karma to be born as a woman. However, according to the Tipitaka, 'Aṭṭhana' means 'not a thing' or 'no reason'. This implies that it is a natural law; regardless of whether society is matriarchal or not, it is absolutely impossible for a woman to become a Buddha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let the scriptures aside; I do not particularly want to discuss them, as it could be argued that those were not Buddha&rsquo;s words, but an addition after his death. I shall not argue nor promote the statement, as the concern lies on the scholars. Instead, I would like to point out the obvious forms of gender discrimination prevalent in the current Burmese Buddhist community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most prominent example is the issue of whether women are allowed to access certain places pagodas. However, this is not a religious discrimination as the Tipitaka does not say, &lsquo;Women are not allowed to go up to the pagoda.&rsquo; The origin of this discrimination is rooted Burmese culture (even in the Bagan era, this did not exist. The culture that emerged later), but it is a discrimination practised within the Buddhism religion sphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Some argue that feminists strongly emphasise whether or not they can go up to the pagoda. They say &lsquo;So what if you can go up? What significant changes will occur?&rsquo; Indeed, in terms of results, even if women are allowed to go up to the pagoda, there will not be any extraordinary changes, such as the downfall of patriarchy. Regardless of the outcome, discrimination exists in principle, and we are simply pointing it out)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another notable example is the issue of ordination of bhikkhunis. As mentioned above, although the scriptures impose stricter disciplinary rules on bhikkhunis, the Buddha did permit the bhikkhuni order. Even though the bhikkhuni order has disappeared in Myanmar, it can be revived. The Venerable Ādiccavaṃsa wrote the "Bhikkhuni Sasanopadesa"<a href="#sdendnote5sym" name="sdendnote5anc"><sup>v</sup></a> treatise in 1935, stating that the bhikkhuni order could and should be revived. But, the Burmese Sangha community scorned it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, a Burmese woman, <u><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/story-one-burmese-nun/">Venerable Saccavadi</a></u> received bhikkhuni ordination in Sri Lanka. Burmese monks in Sri Lanka told her that bhikkhuni ordination was not allowed for women, and reported her to Sangha Mahanāyaka Committee (SSMNC), government-appointed body of high-ranking Buddhist monks that oversees and regulates the Sangha in Burma. Nevertheless, she and her decided to become a bhikkhuni in 2003, and became the first female Burmese to attain such status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when she returned to Myanmar in 2005, due to her father being ill, the Sangha Mahanāyaka launched a &lsquo;formal investigation&rsquo; regarding to her bhikkhuni ordination. Soon, The committee forcely ordered<a href="#sdendnote6sym" name="sdendnote6anc"><sup>vi</sup></a>Venerable Saccavadi to disrobe, and sentenced her to five years in prison<a href="#sdendnote7sym" name="sdendnote7anc"><sup>vii</sup></a>. Additionally, the monastic journey of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/burmese/articles/clezewjw9wjo.">Venerable Gunacariy,</a> a Burmese bhikkhuni residing in America, was not smooth. Her own guru, the Shwetaung Gon Sayadaw, took nine years to recognise her as a bhikkhuni.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considering these points, it is not necessary to think further to realise that there are monks in the Burmese Sangha organisation who are fearful of the revival of the bhikkhuni order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for final example, I would like to discuss the issue of <em>thilashin</em> (female nuns). In Myanmar Theravada Buddhism, since the bhikkhuni order has died out, women can only take the vows of a <em>thilashin</em>, which is the highest they can attain. The <em>thilashin</em> order is not a monastic order established by Gautama Buddha, nor can it be considered part of the Sangha. Therefore, a <em>thilashin</em> can be regarded as a female ascetic living according to the Buddha's teachings. Since <em>thilashin</em> are not bhikkhunis, they do not have to follow the Bhikkhuni Vinaya (disciplinary code), but they follow a total of 95 precepts, including the ten basic precepts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at this, it can be understood that <em>thilashin</em> are superior in terms of sīla to ordinary laypeople. However, <em>thilashin</em> are not even given as much respect as ordinary people. Lay men (even if they offer A&ntilde;jali Mudrā) never give bows with the five points of contact to <em>thilashin</em>. The reason given for not is the fear that a man's merit would decrease if he prostrates to a woman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this patriarchal world, even in noble ways of spiritual liberation, gender-based discrimination exists in its own form and characteristics. Regardless of whether it exists or not in the original scriptures, it is undeniable that those who follow these scriptural teachings drive the patriarchal machinery within the religious sphere. Because of this, without opposing religion itself, we highlight and point out the gender discrimination that arises within the religious framework, hoping that individuals will continue to think, discuss, debate, and take a step towards change. With this belief, we conclude this article from the Voice of Ittiya.</p>
